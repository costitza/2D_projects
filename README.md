# C++ SFML Learning

This repository is a collection of small projects and experiments while learning **basic graphics programming** using **C++** and **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

The goal of this repo is to practice:
- Rendering shapes, sprites, and textures
- Handling window events
- Keyboard and mouse input
- Basic game loop structure

### Requirements
To build and run the examples, you will need:
- A C++17 compatible compiler
- SFML installed on your system

Download SFML here:
https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

### Running
Make sure the required SFML DLLs are placed next to the executable before running (if using Windows).
You can also use **build** that gets you any flag needed in order to make the executable

### "build" usage
```bash
./build *.cpp file.exe
```

### Notes
This repository is for **learning purposes only** — expect messy code, experiments, and incremental improvements over time 😄

Feel free to check out the code and try the examples!
